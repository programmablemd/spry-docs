# Spry End-User Guide

> Executable Markdown for QA Engineers, Data Scientists, and DevOps Engineers

## What is Spry?

Spry is a lightweight TypeScript ecosystem that treats Markdown as a **programmable medium**. Instead of just documenting code, your Markdown **becomes** the code—every fenced block, section, and directive can execute, compose, and produce reproducible outputs.

Think of Spry as a bridge between documentation and execution. Your runbooks, data pipelines, and application logic live together in a single, human-readable Markdown file that can be versioned, reviewed, and executed like traditional code.

**💡 Built for Modern Workflows**

Spry is especially powerful for QA engineers building audit-ready test cases, data scientists creating reproducible analyses, and DevOps teams maintaining executable runbooks.

### Executable Markdown

Every fenced code block in your Markdown can be executed as a task. Spry understands multiple languages and can run shell scripts, SQL queries, TypeScript code, and more—all from within your documentation.

````markdown
```bash cleanup --descr "Remove old build artifacts"
rm -rf dist/ build/
```
````

### Task Dependencies

Define dependencies between tasks to create complex workflows. Spry automatically resolves the execution order and can run independent tasks in parallel.

````markdown
```bash test --depends build
npm test
```

```bash deploy --depends test
./deploy.sh production
```
````

### SQLPage Integration

Spry has first-class support for SQLPage, allowing you to define entire database-driven web applications in a single Markdown file. Define your schema, queries, and UI components all in one place.

### Audit-Ready Evidence

Capture task execution results as JSON artifacts with timestamps and metadata. Perfect for compliance documentation and automated testing scenarios.

## Use Cases

  <Card title="Policies as Code" href="#recipe-1-audit-ready-evidence-policies-as-code">
    Create verifiable test cases for compliance frameworks with automated evidence capture.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Applications" href="#recipe-2-building-a-data-application-sqlpage">
    Build SQLite or PostgreSQL-backed dashboards with SQLPage integration.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Executable Runbooks" href="#recipe-3-executable-runbooks-devops">
    Automate DevOps workflows with pre-flight checks, deployments, and rollbacks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reproducible Research">
    Document data science workflows that can be re-executed with guaranteed reproducibility.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Core Philosophy

Spry embraces three core principles:

1. **Documentation as Code**: Your Markdown files are both documentation and executable programs
2. **Reproducibility**: Every execution can be reproduced with the same inputs and environment
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with simple scripts and progressively add structure, dependencies, and metadata

<Callout>
Spry works seamlessly with version control systems like Git, making it easy to track changes to your executable documentation over time.
