This FAQ covers common questions and pitfalls when **setting up and using Spry**, a lightweight TypeScript ecosystem that treats Markdown as executable, composable workflows.

---

## What *is* Spry?

Spry treats **Markdown as a programmable medium** — instead of just documentation, `.md` files become executable workflows. Spry interprets fenced code blocks and directives as executable units with dependencies, metadata, and outputs. 

---

## Installation & Setup

### **Q: What are the prerequisites?**

Spry runs using **Deno** (type-safe TypeScript runtime), so ensure you have:

```bash
deno --version
````

…installed (version 2.5+ is recommended).

---

### **Q: How do I bootstrap a new Spry project?**

Use the built-in CLI initializer:

```bash
# Create or navigate to an empty project directory
cd <your-project>

# Bootstrap a Spry + SQLPage project
deno run --node-modules-dir=auto -A \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programmablemd/spry/main/lib/sqlpage/cli.ts init

# Verify
./spry.ts help
```

This generates:

* `spry.ts` — Spry CLI runner
* `Spryfile.md` — executable Markdown workflow
* SQLPage config files (if applicable)

---

### **Q: Why am I seeing permission errors when running Spry?**

Spry may need access to file systems, network, and subprocesses. Use Deno’s permission flags `-A` (allow all), or more targeted flags:

```bash
deno run -A spry.ts <command>
```

For production, tighten permissions as needed.

---

## Writing Spry Workflows

### **Q: What goes into `Spryfile.md`?**

Spry treats every fenced code block as an *executable cell*. Code blocks should have a language tag + valid Spry directives:

````md
```sql {.store-result}
SELECT * FROM users;
```
````


If code blocks lack proper language or directive attributes, execution may skip them.

---

### **Q: How do I debug why a block didn’t run?**

- Check that the fence has a **supported language tag** and any required attributes (`.store-result`, `.task`, etc.).  
- Run Spry with verbose or watch mode to see logs.  
- Validate there are no invalid dependencies between tasks.

---

## Development & Workflow

### **Q: How can I watch for changes and rebuild automatically?**

Use Spry’s watch mode:

```bash
./spry.ts spc \
  --fs dev-src.auto \
  --destroy-first \
  --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json \
  --watch \
  --with-sqlpage
````

This monitors changes and rebuilds on update.

---

### **Q: How do I package my Spry workflows for production?**

You can **bundle into a single SQLite or PostgreSQL database**:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 spry-sqlpage.sqlite.db
```

Or pipe to a Postgres instance:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | psql
```

Production outputs include compiled SQLPage assets and workflow metadata.

---

## Common Issues

### Installation Problems

* Ensure **Deno is installed and up-to-date**.
* Check you are in the correct directory when initializing.
* If Spry CLI doesn’t run, verify your shebang (`./spry.ts`) and executable permission. 

---

### Spryfile.md Won’t Execute

* Confirm language tags and Spry attributes are valid.
* Some tools strip attributes — ensure your editor preserves them.
* Validate there are no syntax errors in Markdown. 

---

###  SQLPage Integration Issues

* Ensure `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` exists and is configured correctly.
* Check that `dev-src.auto/` is generated during development.
* Verify database connection strings are correct. 

---

### ❗ Performance Issues

Large workflows can slow execution:

* Split into **smaller, independent Spry files**.
* Use task dependencies efficiently.
* Monitor with `--watch` during active development. 

---

## Getting Help

If you run into issues:

* **Search existing GitHub issues** before posting.
* **GitHub Discussions** — ask questions and share ideas.
* **Discord Community** — chat realtime with Spry users and contributors.
* **Documentation** — check Getting Started and API References. 

---

## Tips & Best Practices

* Prefer **explicit directives and metadata** in code blocks for clarity.
* Use task naming and dependencies to structure workflows cleanly.
* When possible, keep workflows small and composable.
* Test blocks independently before integrating into larger Spry projects.

## Quick Reference

| Task                   | Developer Command          | Executable Package Command |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Initialize project     | `deno run ... cli.ts init` | `spry sp init `            |
| Show help              | `./spry.ts help`           | `spry help`                |
| Watch mode             | `./spry.ts sp spc --watch` | `spry sp spc --watch`      |
| Package for production | `./spry.ts spc --package`  | `spry sp spc --package`    |
