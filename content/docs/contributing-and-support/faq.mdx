This FAQ covers common questions and pitfalls when **setting up and using Spry**, a lightweight TypeScript ecosystem that treats Markdown as executable, composable workflows.

---

## What is Spry?

Spry is an ecosystem of TypeScript libraries that treat **Markdown as a programmable medium** — instead of just documentation, `.md` files become executable workflows. Spry interprets fenced code blocks and directives as executable units with dependencies, metadata, and outputs.

### What can I use Spry for?

- **DevOps Runbooks** - Executable operations documentation
- **Data Pipelines** - ETL workflows in Markdown
- **Compliance Automation** - Policy-as-code with evidence generation
- **SQLPage Apps** - SQL-based web dashboards
- **Build Automation** - Task orchestration

### How is Spry different from Make/Task/Just?

Spry documents are also valid Markdown. You can read them on GitHub, in VS Code, or any Markdown viewer. The documentation *is* the automation, not separate files.

---

## Installation & Setup

### What are the prerequisites?

Spry runs using **Deno** (type-safe TypeScript runtime), so ensure you have:

```bash
deno --version
```

### What are the system requirements?

- **Deno 2.5+** (required)
- Any OS: Linux, macOS, Windows
- No other dependencies

### How do I bootstrap a new Spry project?

Use the built-in CLI initializer:

```bash
# Create or navigate to an empty project directory
cd <your-project>

# Bootstrap a Spry + SQLPage project using 
./spry.ts sp init


# Verify
./spry.ts help
```

This generates:

* `spry.ts` — Spry CLI runner
* `Spryfile.md` — executable Markdown workflow
* SQLPage config files (if applicable)

### Why am I seeing permission errors when running Spry?

Spry may need access to file systems, network, and subprocesses. Use Deno's permission flags `-A` (allow all), or more targeted flags:

```bash
deno run -A spry.ts <command>
```

For production, tighten permissions as needed.

### Do I need to know TypeScript?

No. Basic Spry usage only requires Markdown and shell scripting. TypeScript is only needed for extending Spry or using the programmatic API.

### Can I use Spry with Node.js?

Spry is built on Deno, not Node.js. However, your Spryfiles can execute any commands, including Node.js scripts.

### Is there a Docker image?

Not officially, but you can create one:

```dockerfile
FROM denoland/deno:2.5.0
RUN deno install -A -n spry https://raw.githubusercontent.com/programmablemd/spry/main/bin/spry.ts
```

---

## Writing Spry Workflows

### What file extension should I use?

Use `.md` for Spryfiles. Common naming conventions:
- `Spryfile.md` - Main project file
- `runbook.md` - Operational runbook
- `deploy.md` - Deployment workflow

### What goes into `Spryfile.md`?

Spry treats every fenced code block as an *executable cell*. Code blocks should have a language tag + valid Spry directives:

````md
```sql {.store-result}
SELECT * FROM users;
```
````

If code blocks lack proper language or directive attributes, execution may skip them.

### Can I have multiple Spryfiles?

Yes. You can organize complex projects across multiple files and run them independently.

### Are there limits on file size?

No hard limits, but large files may impact performance. Consider splitting files over 1000 lines.

### How do I debug why a block didn't run?

- Check that the fence has a **supported language tag** and any required attributes (`.store-result`, `.task`, etc.).  
- Run Spry with verbose or watch mode to see logs.  
- Validate there are no invalid dependencies between tasks.

---

## Tasks

### What languages can I execute?

Any language that can run as a command:
- Shell (bash, sh, zsh)
- Python
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Go
- Rust
- Any CLI tool

### How do I pass arguments to tasks?

Currently, arguments are set via environment variables:

```bash
MY_ARG="value" spry rb run file.md
```

In the task:
```bash
echo "Argument: $MY_ARG"
```

### Can tasks run in parallel?

Currently, tasks run sequentially in topological order. Tasks without dependencies between them could run in parallel in future versions.

### How do I skip a task?

Use conditional logic in the task itself:

````markdown
```bash conditional-task
if [ "$SKIP_TASK" = "true" ]; then
    echo "Skipping"
    exit 0
fi
# Rest of task...
```
````

### What happens if a task fails?

By default, execution stops on the first failure. Use `--continue-on-error` to continue, or add `--continue-on-error` to specific tasks.

---

## Dependencies

### How are dependencies resolved?

Spry builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) from `--dep` declarations and executes tasks in topological order.

### Can I have optional dependencies?

Not directly. Use conditional logic in tasks to handle optional behavior.

### What if I have circular dependencies?

Spry detects and reports circular dependencies. You must remove one dependency to break the cycle.

---

## Development & Workflow

### How can I watch for changes and rebuild automatically?

Use Spry's watch mode:

```bash
./spry.ts spc \
  --fs dev-src.auto \
  --destroy-first \
  --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json \
  --watch \
  --with-sqlpage
```

This monitors changes and rebuilds on update.

### How do I package my Spry workflows for production?

You can **bundle into a single SQLite or PostgreSQL database**:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | sqlite3 spry-sqlpage.sqlite.db
```

Or pipe to a Postgres instance:

```bash
./spry.ts spc --package --conf sqlpage/sqlpage.json | psql
```

Production outputs include compiled SQLPage assets and workflow metadata.

---

## SQLPage

### What databases are supported?

- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server

### Can I use SQLPage without a database?

SQLite in-memory mode works: `sqlite://:memory:`

### How do I deploy SQLPage apps?

1. Build: `./spry.ts sp spc Spryfile.md --fs`
2. Deploy the generated SQL files with SQLPage
3. See [SQLPage Dashboards](../use-cases/sqlpage-data-app)

### SQLPage Integration Issues

* Ensure `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` exists and is configured correctly.
* Check that `dev-src.auto/` is generated during development.
* Verify database connection strings are correct.

---

## Configuration

### Where does configuration go?

1. **Document frontmatter** - In the Spryfile
2. **Environment variables** - `SPRY_*`
3. **Command-line flags** - Override at runtime

### How do I use secrets?

Never put secrets in Spryfiles. Use environment variables:

```yaml
---
api_key: ${env.API_KEY}
---
```

### Can I share configuration between files?

Use environment variables or include common configuration via the `include` directive.

---

## Common Issues

### Installation Problems

* Ensure **Deno is installed and up-to-date**.
* Check you are in the correct directory when initializing.
* If Spry CLI doesn't run, verify your shebang (`./spry.ts`) and executable permission.

### Spryfile.md Won't Execute

* Confirm language tags and Spry attributes are valid.
* Some tools strip attributes — ensure your editor preserves them.
* Validate there are no syntax errors in Markdown.

### Performance Issues

Large workflows can slow execution:

* Split into **smaller, independent Spry files**.
* Use task dependencies efficiently.
* Monitor with `--watch` during active development.

## Comparison

### Spry vs Jupyter Notebooks

| Feature | Spry | Jupyter |
|---------|------|---------|
| Format | Plain Markdown | JSON |
| Execution | CLI/CI | Interactive |
| Version control | Excellent | Challenging |
| Languages | Any | Kernel-based |

### Spry vs Ansible/Terraform

| Feature | Spry | Ansible/Terraform |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Documentation + Automation | Infrastructure automation |
| Format | Markdown | YAML/HCL |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium-High |

## Tips & Best Practices

* Prefer **explicit directives and metadata** in code blocks for clarity.
* Use task naming and dependencies to structure workflows cleanly.
* When possible, keep workflows small and composable.
* Test blocks independently before integrating into larger Spry projects.
